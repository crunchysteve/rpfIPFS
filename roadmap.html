    <h2>Crunchysteve's Roadmap</h2>

    <p>
        The roadmap is to learn javascript, then learn React and React Native, then build apps that are 
        decentralised and serverless. The final destination is to build something that looks like the 
        mockup image below.

        It sort of looks like a list view of posts, right? That's exactly what it is! It's a mockup of a 
        newsfeed. There will be no centralised server, just an address book and, if I appear in yours, 
        and you appear in mine, we will see each other's posts. The one we want to read we will tap, it 
        will open, and we will see a comment thread below the article, except that, unless at least one
        commentor is in your address book, you won't be able to reply unless they set their comments as 
        public. Yeah, there needs to be a lot of learning, thinking, sketching and development.

        I've found the road. Lets see where it leads and draw the map.
